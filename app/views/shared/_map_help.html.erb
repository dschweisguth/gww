<p>Photos that were guessed or revealed recently are marked with darker colors;
photos that were guessed or revealed less recently are marked with lighter colors.
A limited number of photos can be shown on the map, so zoom in to see older photos.
Photos that are not mapped, or that are mapped only with low accuracy, are not shown or counted on this page.</p>

<p>Photos that would otherwise appear in exactly the same spot are spread out in a little spiral so you can see them all.
This mostly affects auto-mapped photos, which are often auto-mapped to an intersection or to the middle of a block.
The original position of those photos wasn't accurate anyway, so spreading them out doesn't make them much less accurate.</p>
