<p>The guesser's zeal for guessing the poster is calculated as</p>
<p>((the number of times the guesser has guessed the poster) /
(the number of photos the poster has posted)) /<br/>
((the number of photos the guesser has guessed) /
(the number of photos that have been posted)).</p>
<p>Zeal is calculated only if the guesser has guessed the poster ten or more times.</p>
<p>Zeal isn't adjusted for the periods of time that the guesser and poster have played the game.
If the number is high, the guesser is clearly out to get the poster.
But if the number is low, it might mean that the guesser isn't trying,
the poster's posts are unusually hard to guess,
or just that the guesser and poster played the game at different times.</p>
