<%= @total_correct_guessers %> people have made correct guesses. <%= @total_posters_only %> people have put at least one photo in the pool but not guessed any photos correctly. That means that at least <%= @total_participants %> of our <%= @member_count %> members have participated in the game.

Here are the <%= @total_correct_guessers - @total_single_guessers %> people who've correctly guessed two or more photos; in parentheses following each name is the number of photos that person has put in the pool:
