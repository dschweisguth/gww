<%# The HTML generated by this partial and the partials it includes must work when pasted into a Flickr discussion topic. %>
<%# Briefly, newlines are treated as <br/>s and only some tags and attributes can be used. %>
<%# Also, the entire report must be < 40,756 characters (as tested by Octoferret). %>
<%# Usually reports are bigger than that, so we split them in half. %>
<%# In any case, it's important to avoid unnecessary bulk, which is why we use b instead of strong and no img height or width. %>
<%# alt and title are considered necessary for now. %>
<%# In the future we might try removing http://www.flickr.com from URLs in the posted version. %>
<%# Test by pasting it in to a Flickr discussion topic, e.g in the Guess Where SF Test group. %>
