Guess Where Watcher (GWW) is the scoring tool for the Guess Where SF Flickr
group. It was written by Tomas Apodaca and is currently maintained by Dave
Schweisguth.

GWW is currently used only by Guess Where SF administrators, so there is no
running instance available to the general public. This will change in the near
future; stay tuned.
