Right away:

Make tests pass
Dump current schema and junk migrations
Add indexes to database correctly
Move credentials to configuration
Back up database automatically
Open database to others if they're interested
Remove dead code
Drop nudges table
Fix all broken pages
Review all pages for performance and add more indexes if appropriate
Add note about automatic update to index page

Soon:

Add source code and backup information to home page
Rewrite treasures HTML to be postable
New server
Reduce distance between gww's ruby dependencies and current stable versions
Replace mod_fastcgi with mod_fcgid or mod_rails
Remove hardcoded timezone difference from people_controller.rb
Why is http://www.flickr.com/photos/inarges/385184385/ not in treasures?
Is photos.dateadded really date uploaded? If so, can we also track date added
    to group?

Later:

Open appropriate parts of GWW to players
    Move GWW to guesswheresf.com
Provide page for players which lists scoring actions (guesses and revelations),
    and possibly score publication times, newest to oldest. Consider whether
    scoring in batches is an important part of game fun.
Add to player page
- link to Flickr account
- youngest and oldest guesses (treasures)
- youngests and oldest guesses by others (inverse treasures)
- emphasis on nemeses
