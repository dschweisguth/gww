Bug: Revealing a photo sometimes stores the wrong revealed_at date. See my
  trash cans and raccoon post.
Put score and place after username in score report
Extract duplication from different versions of score report controller and view
Move last-update stuff to FlickrUpdate. Use limit 1 or 2.
Remove hardcoded timezone difference from {people,photos}_controller.rb
photos and guesses have people_ids which don't correspond to people. Fix.
    Look for other unenforced foreign keys and fix those too.
Fix unknown links from people/show. potato potato, ID 13, is a test case.
If possible, fix guesses' invalid person IDs, remove missing-person check from
  person/show and use eager loading
Attempt to speed up reports by page caching
Attempt to speed up pages which access Flickr by using newer APIs
Add more info to unfound list to make it easier to find a specific photo
New server
Reduce distance between gww's ruby dependencies and current stable versions
Replace mod_fastcgi with mod_fcgid or mod_rails
Revisit attempt to speed up photos/update by improving ActiveRecord usage
Paginate or limit pages that currently take forever, e.g. commented_on
Open appropriate parts of GWW to players
    Move GWW to guesswheresf.com
Review test coverage and add TODOs to write more tests and assertions
Show photo's tags as well as comments. Highlight foundinSF/unfoundinSF.
Is photos.dateadded really date uploaded? If so, can we also track date added
    to group, to support the shortest/longest time-to-guess report?
Add update completion time to home page
Post scores to Flickr group automatically. Record scoring time and add to home
    page.
Automatically publish the score report to the group's scoring thread instead
    of making the scorer copy and paste
Add a search feature
Provide page for players which lists scoring actions (guesses and revelations),
    and possibly score publication times, newest to oldest. Consider whether
    scoring in batches is an important part of game fun and if so how not to
    compromise that.
Add to player page
- link to Flickr account
- youngest and oldest guesses (treasures)
- youngests and oldest guesses by others (inverse treasures)
- emphasize nemeses
- unconfirmeds
Add last-updated dates to photos which
- reflect only things relevant to scoring
- reflect only things relevant to players
