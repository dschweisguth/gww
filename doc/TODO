Right away:

Look for and fix time zone corrections
Dump current schema and junk migrations
Add indexes to database correctly
Back up database automatically
Open database to others if they're interested
Remove dead code
Drop nudges table
Add note about automatic update to index page

Soon:

Add source code and backup information to home page
Add more info to unfound list to make it easier to find a specific photo
Rewrite treasures HTML to be postable
Attempt to speed up treasures by using ActiveRecord's join support
The unverified photos list is intended to list those photos not seen during the
    last update, so that unfound ones can be removed from the pool. (Found ones
    stay in the pool to preserve scores.) Right now it shows all photos. Fix
    it.
Attempt to speed up unverified photos by looking up each person only once.
    Multiple lookups of each people.id appear in the development log. But look
    in to Rails caching first to see if it's a non-issue in production.
Review test coverage and add TODOs to write more tests and assertions
New server
Reduce distance between gww's ruby dependencies and current stable versions
Replace mod_fastcgi with mod_fcgid or mod_rails
Remove hardcoded timezone difference from people_controller.rb
Why is http://www.flickr.com/photos/inarges/385184385/ not in treasures?
Is photos.dateadded really date uploaded? If so, can we also track date added
    to group?
Why does anythreewords.com not match the unfound XML, and why does that not
    match the database?

Later:

Put the score reporting range under admin control? See ongoing email
    discussion.
Show photo's tags as well as comments. Highlight foundinSF/unfoundinSF.
Automatically publish the score report to the group's scoring thread instead
    of making the scorer copy and paste
Add a search feature
Open appropriate parts of GWW to players
    Move GWW to guesswheresf.com
Provide page for players which lists scoring actions (guesses and revelations),
    and possibly score publication times, newest to oldest. Consider whether
    scoring in batches is an important part of game fun and if so how not to
    compromise that.
Add to player page
- link to Flickr account
- youngest and oldest guesses (treasures)
- youngests and oldest guesses by others (inverse treasures)
- emphasize nemeses
- unconfirmeds
