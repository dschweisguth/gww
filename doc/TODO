Bugs

If a photo is private but in the group, so that getFavorites fails, is it
  updated every time?
After http://code.google.com/p/phusion-passenger/issues/detail?id=563 is fixed, reinstate page caching
A photo which is guessed or revealed and then removed from the group remains
  in the database but is no longer updated
The username of a commenter on a photo which is guessed or revealed and then
  made private or deleted is no longer updated

Debt

Extract methods from update_all_from_flickr
