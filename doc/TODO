x Bug: "Add this guess" fails with a manually entered person
Attempt to speed up treasures and other pages by improving ActiveRecord usage
Attempt to speed up reports by page caching
Attempt to speed up pages which access Flickr by using newer APIs
New server
photos and guesses have people_ids which don't correspond to people. Fix.
    Look for other unenforced foreign keys and fix those too.
Review test coverage and add TODOs to write more tests and assertions
Reduce distance between gww's ruby dependencies and current stable versions
Replace mod_fastcgi with mod_fcgid or mod_rails
Revisit effect of Rails query caching
Add report of photos for which more than one point was awarded, as some seem to
    be incorrect.
    select p.id, pe.username, pe.flickrid, p.flickrid, count(*)
    from photos p, guesses g, people pe
    where p.id = g.photo_id and p.person_id = pe.id
    group by p.flickrid having count(*) > 1 order by p.id;
Remove hardcoded timezone difference from {people,photos}_controller.rb
Paginate or limit pages that currently take forever, e.g. commented_on
Is photos.dateadded really date uploaded? If so, can we also track date added
    to group, to support the shortest/longest time-to-guess report?
Add more info to unfound list to make it easier to find a specific photo
Add update completion time to home page
Add thumbnails to score report
Post scores to Flickr group automatically. Record scoring time and add to home
    page.
Show photo's tags as well as comments. Highlight foundinSF/unfoundinSF.
Automatically publish the score report to the group's scoring thread instead
    of making the scorer copy and paste
Add a search feature
Open appropriate parts of GWW to players
    Move GWW to guesswheresf.com
Provide page for players which lists scoring actions (guesses and revelations),
    and possibly score publication times, newest to oldest. Consider whether
    scoring in batches is an important part of game fun and if so how not to
    compromise that.
Add to player page
- link to Flickr account
- youngest and oldest guesses (treasures)
- youngests and oldest guesses by others (inverse treasures)
- emphasize nemeses
- unconfirmeds
Add last-updated dates to photos which
- reflect only things relevant to scoring
- reflect only things relevant to players
