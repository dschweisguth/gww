Database
--------

To help protect the GWW database from programmer error and other potential
damage, the GWW schema and its migrations use SQL features which are not
natively supported by Active Record, such as foreign key constraints and the
enum column type. Therefore,

- The GWW schema and its migrations will probably not work with databases other
  than mysql without some work.
- GWW needs slightly different database-related Rake tasks than those which
  come with ActiveRecord. See doc/INSTALL and lib/tasks/databases.rake.

Note that some of the indexes which support the GWW schema's foreign keys are
essential for performance, although non-foreign key indexes would serve that
purpose equally well.


Javascript
----------

GWW uses jQuery UI's smoothness theme. Fortunately, that theme is the one
provided by the jquery-ui-rails gem.


Terminology
-----------

"Posted to the group" and "Added to the group" mean the same thing. "Posted"
is used in most places. "Posted", not "added", is the opposite of "guessed".
The noun "post" is the opposite of the noun "guess"; there is no noun "add".
"Added" is used only when we're distinguishing the dates on which a photo
was taken and added to the group.
