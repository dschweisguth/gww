This document describes how to install GWW on a Mac (for development, using
webrick) or Linux server (for production, using Apache httpd and FastCGI). It
covers only what Dave thinks is not obvious; please fill gaps as you encounter
them.

Install and start mysql
-----------------------

    Mac
	Install mysql 5 with MacPorts per
	    http://2tbsp.com/content/install_and_configure_mysql_5_macports
	Start mysql: sudo /opt/local/share/mysql5/mysql/mysql.server start
	Stop mysql: /opt/local/bin/mysqladmin5 -uroot -p shutdown
    Linux
        TODO

Install ruby and friends
------------------------

GWW currently requires ruby 1.8.something (the current version of 1.9 is too
new), rubygems 1.3.1 (the current version, 1.3.5, is too new) and the gems
listed below. Some of the detail below probably isn't required, but that's what
I have.

Install ruby
    Mac: Use MacPorts.
    Linux: Get source from http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ and follow instructions
	> ruby --version
	ruby 1.8.7 (2010-01-10 patchlevel 249) [i686-linux]

Install gem
    Mac: Use MacPorts.
    Linux: Get source from http://gems.rubyforge.org/ and follow instructions.
	> gem --version
	1.3.1

Install gems

    gem install rails --version 1.1.6
    gem install actionpack --version 1.13.6
    gem install actionwebservice --version 1.2.6
    gem install mysql
    gem install xml-simple
    > gem list
    actionmailer (1.2.5)
    actionpack (1.13.6, 1.12.5)
    actionwebservice (1.2.6, 1.1.6)
    activerecord (1.15.6, 1.14.4)
    activesupport (1.4.4, 1.3.1)
    mysql (2.8.1)
    rails (1.1.6)
    rake (0.8.7)
    xml-simple (1.0.12)

    When using gem, beware version conflicts between executables and libraries
    in installed gems. Always use the -x option with uninstall. If a gem
    doesn't work, try uninstalling it and reinstalling it.

On Linux, with the above set of software, loading any GWW page results in the
following error when attempting to load /stylesheets/screen.css:

ERROR NoMethodError: private method `gsub!' called for #<Class:0xb7cfbc84>

To fix, make the following change:

[root lonnrot:/usr/local/lib/ruby/1.8/webrick] diff htmlutils.rb{.old,}
15c15
<       str = string ? string.dup : ""
---
>       str = string ? string.dup.to_s : ""

A newer webrick or an older ruby would probably solve the problem more cleanly.

Install FastCGI (for Linux production)
--------------------------------------

Background: Dave runs GWW under Apache so that Apache can provide HTTP basic
    authentication. mod_rails wouldn't build on Dave's old server, so Dave used
    FastCGI. The situation could be simplified either by moving to a newer
    server that handled mod_rails or adding basic HTTP authentication to GWW
    itself and running it under some other, possibly Ruby-centric, web server,
    on a port other than 80.
Dave mostly followed http://www.xmlareas.com/ruby-on-rails-howto .
Install the fcgi library:
    wget http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/fcgi-2.4.0.tar.gz
    configure, make, make install
Install the FastCGI module:
    wget http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/mod_fastcgi-2.4.6.tar.gz (referenced on
	"FastCGI servers", http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/3)
    Compile per the documentation in the distribution, but instead of

        apxs -i -a -n fastcgi mod_fastcgi.so

    do

        apxs -i -a -n fastcgi mod_fastcgi.la

    apxs makes the following change:
	[root lonnrot:/etc/httpd/conf] diff httpd.conf.bak httpd.conf
	189a190
	> LoadModule fastcgi_module     /usr/lib/httpd/modules/mod_fastcgi.so
    gem install fcgi
	[root lonnrot:~] gem list | grep fcgi
	fcgi (0.8.8)
    mkdir /tmp/fcgi_ipc
    chmod 777 /tmp/fcgi_ipc
    Edit httpd.conf (note that this diff includes the change made by apxs):
        [root lonnrot:/etc/httpd/conf] diff httpd.conf{.bak,}
	189a190,194
	> LoadModule fastcgi_module     /usr/lib/httpd/modules/mod_fastcgi.so
	> <IfModule mod_fastcgi.c> 
	>   FastCgiConfig -minProcesses 1 -maxProcesses 5 -idle-timeout 100000 -initial-env RAILS_ENV=production
	>   FastCgiIpcDir /tmp/fcgi_ipc
	> </IfModule>
	311c316
	<     AllowOverride AuthConfig
	---
	>     AllowOverride All
    apachectl restart

Get and configure GWW
---------------------

Get the source: Either
    Browse http://github.com/dschweisguth/gww, click "Download Source", pick a
        format, download it and unpack it, or
    git clone git@github.com:dschweisguth/gww.git
Configure:
    Configure database credentials:
	cp config/database{_template,}.yml
	Edit and fill in your database username and password
    Configure Flickr credentials:
	cp config/flickr_credentials{_template,}.yml
	Construct a Flickr API secret, key and auth token manually per the
	    API documentation
	Edit and fill in your secret, api_key and auth_token
For production Linux httpd,
    chmod -R apache:apache gww
    ln -s /.../gww/public /var/www/html/gww
    Create a username and password per
        http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/auth.html
    Configure basic HTTP authentication:
        cp public/.htaccess{_template,}
	Edit and fill in the userid that you want to use for basic HTTP
	    authentication
	Change the path to the password file if necessary

Create databases
----------------

grant usage on *.* to gww@localhost identified by '(the password)';
Create dev database:
    create database gww_dev default charset latin1;
    grant all privileges on gww_dev.* to gww@localhost;
    gzcat gww_production-######-##:##.sql.gz | mysql -ugww -p gww_dev
Create production database:
    Do all steps as above, but for gww_production
Create test database:
    Create database and grant privileges as above, but for gww_test
    rake environment RAILS_ENV=test db:schema:load

Test GWW
--------

rake test

Start GWW
---------

Development (Mac):
    script/server
    Browse localhost:3000
